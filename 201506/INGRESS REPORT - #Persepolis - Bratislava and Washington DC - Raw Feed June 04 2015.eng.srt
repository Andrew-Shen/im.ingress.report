the polls are worth the most points and
this event so we can win for

95
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,520 
are fraction in our team and so we are
the top dogged

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800 
right now we're capitalizing on a GRT

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,810 
experience to keep are portal

98
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,610 
bonaparte together here work together as
a team

99
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,900 
but also were using the experience mr.
ingress members are senior

100
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,260 
agents to go ahead and after formals

101
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:44,440 
en route whether there alright mission
field the yeah this is my first time I

102
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,330 
ever gonna go a rockin ever heard the
term before I came here

103
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:54,520 
why

104
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,810 
water 1

105
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,710 
game

106
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,150 
really about people of

107
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,720 
older people to hate we've done for
let's do this graduate

108
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,730 
all your like a we've done more like he
did very collaborative

109
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,270 
experience the operation fish agent for
their physical and mental image right

110
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,690 
now

111
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,270 
we're working to set up and defend our
portals testing by leadership and who

112
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,000 
work

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,740 
you see the two communities merge into
one

114
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,070 
doing stuff that you weren't the only
goal right vice versa so getaway for two

115
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,510 
groups actually go ahead and

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,680 
find something new I think it's fun

117
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,710 
ingress is a game that gets people out
moving walking around and get people

118
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,520 
outdoors

119
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,300 
and they have fun of them

120
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,530 
go work gets people outdoors no good
gets people move

121
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,720 
challenge so they have the same goal

122
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,290 
we come up with the two together just
like I'm there are no words

123
00:07:53,290 --> 00:08:00,440 
really I think I will come back to go
rock and I think I never

124
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,470 
credit limit one participant agent bit
Lake Orion

125
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,590 
keep her pay that he wouldn't trade it
for anything with body

126
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,180 
anything and own Sunday when the
frenetic activity at the anomaly

127
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,750 
settled agent that power in a second
official mission today

128
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,570 
in Bratislava nothing without the
history and culture

129
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,130 
1850 and earning the mission de Barra
I'm confident that will make your day

130
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,370 
events in the future

131
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,800

133
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,770 
the package was later delivered to me by
a bit like the new

134
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,640 
across faction greeted by agents he went
to great lengths think do it rate per

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,190 
page

136
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,360 
I can confirm that the package contains
previously

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,000 
on be in shape eclipse apparently
intercepted by the issue on surveillance

138

program decades ago

139
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,230 
what is this mysterious message I will
be working to uncover its meaning

140
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,760 
it with a full day with and turn but
when the tough couple

141
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,920 
the resistant emerged victorious
although the enlightened lead

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,820 
420 in terms of controlling the
lightning show lifted

143
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,960
